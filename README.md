# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description

This was the first practice of using JavaScript to gather information from a user and use those inputs in calcualtions and other types of ouputs. The project focused heavily on getting user inpute with the prompt command and storing and manipulating that data utilizing loops (for an while). The project also focused on manipulating user data, which was stored as objects in arrays, pulling data from these arrays, calculating averages and using the JavaScript random number generator.
